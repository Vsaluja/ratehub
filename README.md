Ratehub is web app that is inspired from a movie rating platform IMDB. It uses API provided by the movie database and provides an amazing UX/UI experience to the users.

-This web app is built using ReactJS and have used redux toolkit for global state management. I could have used context API for this project but I wanted to enhance my skills by building projects using Redux Toolkit.
-This design was made possible because of the ease of use of SASS/SCSS which made it really easy to write CSS.
-Some advanced concepts of Javascript that are commonly used when building web apps using ReactJS are also used like destructuring, promises, try catch, async await etc.
-Another important feature of this website is the infinite scroll component which uses npm library react-infinite-scroll-component.
-Responsive for all screen resolutions.
-Handled errors.
